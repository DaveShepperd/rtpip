  <em>Note from Dave Shepperd, 10/2022
  <p>
  There never were any release notes kept on this application so there is no record of what got changed when. It just is what it is.
    </p>
    <p>
    Recently I got involved in rebuilding some of old Atari coin-op game code (some of which recently
    was released on github) and wanted to use this tool to extract some old images I had lying around
    in RT-11 container files. I am neither a technical writer nor am I any good at HTML5.
    Feel free to hack this document into something more readable. If you do, please send me a copy.

  <h2>How to run</h2>
  <p>
  <pre>
    <b>rtpip</b> [<em>global_options</em>] <em>container_spec</em> <em>command</em> [<em>cmd_options</em>] [<em>file_list</em>]
    
    Where ([] indicates optional parameter):
    <em>global_options</em> can be one of:
    -d or --debug = set debug mode
    -f or --floppy = image is of a floppy disk
    -F or --double = image is of a double density floppy disk
    -h, -? or --help = This message.
    -lN or --lba=N = set starting LBA to 'N' (defaults to 6)
    -v or --verbose = set verbose mode
    
    <em>container_spec</em> = path to the RT-11 container file.
    
    <em>command</em> = one of <b>del</b>, <b>dir</b>, <b>in</b>, <b>ls</b>, <b>new</b>, <b>out</b>, <b>rm</b> or <b>sqz</b>
    <em>cmd_options</em> = optional options for specific command
    <em>file...</em> = optional input or output filename expressions
    
    For help on a specific <b><em>cmd</em></b>, use:
    
    <b>rtpip</b> <em>anything</em> <b><em>cmd</em> -h</b>
  </pre>
  </p>
  <h2>Command dir or ls</h2>
  <b>rtpip</b> [<em>opts</em>] <b>container ls</b> [<em>command_options</em>] [<em>file_filters</em>]
  <pre>
  Display a listing of files in container file.
  
  The <em>command_options</em> can be one or more of the following:
  
    --help or -h or -? = help specific to ls command.
    --cols=N or -cN or -N = 'N' is a number 1 through 9 indicating columns to output.
    --full or -f = Output full directory information (only if column is not specifed).
    --all or -a = Output all directory information (only if column is not specified).
    --sort=n or -sn = Sort by filename.
    --sort=t or -st = Sort by filetype.
    --sort=d or -sd = Sort by date.
    --sort=s or -ss = Sort by size.
    --reverse or -r = Reverse sort.
    --rexp or -R = filters are regular expressions.
    --verbose or -v = Set verbose mode.
  </pre>
  <p>
  The <em>file_filters</em> are zero or more file filters. If -R or --rexp option is present then the names are 
  interpreted as regular expressions.
  </p>
  <p>
    NOTE: the regular expressions are defined in <b>man 7 regex</b> or <b>man grep</b>.
    I.e. to display only .MAC filenames, use <b>mac$</b> instead of the more typical <b>*.mac</b>.
    <br><br>
		The case of the names used in the filters does not matter (upper or lowercase will work
		equally well). If the regular expression includes shell specific characters, they will
		need to be escaped escaped.
  </p>
  <pre>
    Examples (<b>rt11.dsk</b> is the container file):
    
    Get a full file list of the container rt11sys.sys:
    <b>rtpip rt11.dsk ls -a</b>
    
    Get a list of just files of type .mac:
    <b>rtpip rt11.dsk ls \*.mac</b>

    Get a list of just files of type .mac and .sav:
    <b>rtpip rt11.dsk ls \*.mac \*.sav</b>
  </pre>
  <h2>Command out</h2>
  <b>rtpip</b> [<em>opts</em>] <b>container out</b> [<em>command_options</em>] [<em>file_filters</em>]
  <pre>
  Copy file(s) out of the container.
  
  The <em>command_options</em> can be one or more of the following:
  
    --ascii or -a = Change crlf to just lf. Copy file until control Z or null found. If a Control Z terminates, does not write it.
    --binary or -b = Write file as image (default).
    --help or -h or -? = help specific to out command.
    --outdir=<b>X</b> or -o <b>X</b> = specify the directory into which the files will be output as <b>X</b>. Default is current dir.
    --lower or -l = Change output filename to lowercase.
    --rexp or -R = <em>file_filters</em> are regular expressions.
    --time or -t = maintain file timestamps
    --assumeyes or -y = Assume YES instead of prompting for each file.
  </pre>
  <p>
  The <em>file_filters</em> are one or more file filters. If -R or --rexp option is present then the names are 
  interpreted as regular expressions.
  </p>
  <p>
    NOTE: the regular expressions are defined in <b>man 7 regex</b> or <b>man grep</b>.
    I.e. to display only .MAC filenames, use <b>mac$</b> instead of the more typical <b>*.mac</b>.
    <br><br>
		The case of the names used in the filters does not matter (upper or lowercase will work
		equally well). If the regular expression includes shell specific characters, they will
		need to be escaped escaped.
  </p>
  <pre>
    Examples (<b>rt11.dsk</b> is the container file):
    
    Get a plain binary file named foo.sys:
    <b>rtpip rt11.dsk out foo.sys</b>
    
    Get all the files of type .mac and convert to ascii:
    <b>rtpip rt11.dsk out -a \*.mac</b>

    Get all the files of type .mac, maintain their creation dates, convert filename to lowercase, convert contents to ascii and deposit them into <b>outdir</b>:
    <b>rtpip rt11.dsk out -tl -o outdir \*.mac</b>
  </pre>
  <h2>Command in</h2>
  <b>rtpip</b> [<em>opts</em>] <b>container in</b> [<em>command_options</em>] [<em>file_filters</em>]
  <pre>
  Copy file(s) into the container.
  
  The <em>command_options</em> can be one or more of the following:
  
    --help or -h or -? = help specific to in command.
    --query or -q = Prompt before copying each file (default).
    --ascii or -a = Change lone lf's to crlf.
    --binary or -b = Write file as image (default).
    --date=xx or -d xx = Set rt11 date for files. dd-mmm-yy where 72<=yy<=99.
    --rexp or -R = <em>file_filters</em> are regular expressions.
    --time or -t = maintain file timestamps.
    --assumeyes or -y = Assume YES instead of prompting for each file.
    --verbose or -v = Sets verbose mode.
  </pre>
  <p>
  The <em>file_filters</em> are one or more file filters. If -R or --rexp option is present then the names are 
  interpreted as regular expressions.
  </p>
  <p>
    NOTE: the regular expressions are defined in <b>man 7 regex</b> or <b>man grep</b>.
    I.e. to display only .MAC filenames, use <b>mac$</b> instead of the more typical <b>*.mac</b>.
    If the regular expression includes shell specific characters, they will
		need to be escaped escaped.
    <br><br>
		The case of the names used in the filters does not matter (upper or lowercase will work
		equally well). However, filenames are always converted to uppercase in the container file and
    must conform to valid RT11 no more than 6.3 Rad50 characters.
  </p>
  <pre>
    Examples (<b>rt11.dsk</b> is the container file):
    
    Put a plain binary file named foo.sys:
    <b>rtpip rt11.dsk in foo.sys</b>
    
    Put all the files of type .mac and convert to ascii:
    <b>rtpip rt11.dsk in -a \*.mac</b>

    Put all the files of type .mac, maintain their creation datestamps, convert filename to lowercase, convert contents to ascii:
    <b>rtpip rt11.dsk in -t \*.mac</b>
  </pre>
  <h2>Command del or rm</h2>
  <b>rtpip</b> [<em>opts</em>] <b>container del</b> [<em>command_options</em>] [<em>file_filters</em>]
  <pre>
  Delete file(s) from the container.
  
  The <em>command_options</em> can be one or more of the following:
  
    --help or -h or -? = help specific to del command.
    --rexp or -R = <em>file_filters</em> are regular expressions.
    --assumeyes or -y = Assume YES instead of prompting for each file.
    --verbose or -v = Sets verbose mode.
  </pre>
  <p>
  The <em>file_filters</em> are one or more file filters. If -R or --rexp option is present then the names are 
  interpreted as regular expressions.
  </p>

    NOTE: the regular expressions are defined in <b>man 7 regex</b> or <b>man grep</b>.
    I.e. to display only .MAC filenames, use <b>mac$</b> instead of the more typical <b>*.mac</b>.
    If the regular expression includes shell specific characters, they will
		need to be escaped escaped.
    <br><br>
		The case of the names used in the filters does not matter (upper or lowercase will work
		equally well).
  </p>
  <pre>
    Examples (<b>rt11.dsk</b> is the container file):
    
    Delete a plain binary file named foo.sys:
    <b>rtpip rt11.dsk rm foo.sys</b>
    
    Delete all the files of type .mac:
    <b>rtpip rt11.dsk rm \*.mac</b>
  </pre>
  <h2>Command sqz</h2>
  <b>rtpip</b> [<em>opts</em>] <b>container sqz</b> [<em>command_options</em>]
  <pre>
  Squeeze all empty space in container into a single contigious space.
  
  The <em>command_options</em> can be one or more of the following:
  
    --help or -h or -? = help specific to del command.
    --segments or -s = specify how many segments to be allocated (default is current).
    --assumeyes or -y = Assume YES instead of prompting.
    --verbose or -v = Sets verbose mode.
  </pre>
  <p>
    NOTE 1: The --segments option allows one to increase the number of segments in the
      container. It won't let one set it to less than the current. The maximum number
      of segments is 32 in any case, but on floppy disk container files the
      maximums are 2 for single density and 4 for double density.<br>
      If the segment count is not specified, RTPIP will compute an appropriate segment count based on the number of files
      in the container if each segment is filled only 1/2 full or maintains the current segment count if it is greater than the computed amount.
      <br><br>
      NOTE 2:, the way RTPIP does a squeeze is to make a completely new container file with all new headers and segment
      space and copies all the files from the old one to the new one leaving all the empty space as a single contigious
      space at the end. The old file is renamed to .bak.
  </p>
  <pre>
    Examples (<b>rt11.dsk</b> is the container file):
    
    Squeeze the container file:
    <b>rtpip rt11.dsk sqz</b>
      
    Note that the resulting <b>rt11.dsk</b> is a new one. The unmodified one has been renamed to <b>rt11.dsk.bak</b>.
