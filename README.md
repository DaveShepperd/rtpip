# rtpip
RT11 container file handler.

This is a program written a few years ago (not sure exactly) when I was messing around with old Atari game build tools and what not.
It was using it to get files into and out of containers which then got used with the RT11 and VAX/VMS simulators in SIMH where the files were
really wanted/needed/used. There were other tools available to do this at the time, but either I didn't like them, I could get them to work
or they simply didn't do exactly what I wanted, so I rolled my own as they say. Plus there was my interest in doing it.

In any case, I updated the help messages and wrote a rtpip.html file to help me and anybody else figure out how to use this tool should it ever
be needed in the future (doubtful).

So look in rtpip.html for more details.
